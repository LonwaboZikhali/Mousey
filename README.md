Meet Mousey! 

A game in which we feed a mouse some peanut butter, ensuring that it doesn't die of hunger or get eaten by a hungry cat. It's a Cat-Eat-Mouse world!

'Why peanut butter?' you may ask. I came across an article that I particularly enjoyed reading that debunked the theory of mice being obsessed with cheese. The article can be found below:

An extract from the article:

"Instead, what house mice really seem to love is peanut butter. 'They have a good sense of smell, and it has a pretty strong odor,' Phifer-Rixey said. Plus, peanut butter has plenty of protein and fat, which mice find attractive, she added."

I am a budding Software Engineer and decided to try out building a game, and this was the result.

The game is a work-in-progress and I would appreciate any feedback and suggestions you may have. I am particularly looking into making the game mobile-friendly.

Happy Mouse-feeding!
